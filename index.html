                            <li>Sugar</li>
                            <li>Maida (flour)</li>

                        <h3>Recipe</h3>
                        <ol class="recbox">
                            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, flour, baking soda, and cardamom powder.</li>
                            <li>Add ghee and mix until the mixture is crumbly.</li>
                            <li>Slowly add milk, little by little, to form a soft dough. Don't knead it too hard, just bring it together.</li>
                            <li>Let the dough rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
                            <li>In the meantime, prepare the sugar syrup: In a saucepan, combine water and sugar. Heat until the sugar dissolves completely, then add cardamom powder and rose water (optional). Let it simmer for 5-7 minutes and keep it warm.</li>
                            <li>Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over low to medium heat.</li>
                            <li>Divide the dough into small portions and gently roll them into smooth balls. Be careful not to apply too much pressure while rolling.</li>
                            <li>Once the oil is heated, gently drop the balls into the oil. Fry the gulab jamuns on low heat, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Remove the fried gulab jamuns and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for 30 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Serve warm or at room temperature. Enjoy your delicious Gulab Jamuns!</li>

                        <ul class="ingbox">
                            <li>1 packet of rasgullas (or homemade rasgullas, 8-10 pieces)</li>
                            <li>2 cups full-fat milk</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Recipe</h3>
                        <ol class="recbox">
                            <li>Start by squeezing out the syrup from the rasgullas, if using store-bought ones. Gently press them to remove excess syrup and set aside.</li>
                            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the full-fat milk to a boil. Once it boils, reduce the heat to medium and let it simmer. Stir occasionally.</li>
                            <li>Add the sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron (along with its milk) to the simmering milk. Stir well and let it cook for 10-15 minutes until the milk thickens slightly.</li>
                            <li>Add the heavy cream to the milk mixture and continue simmering for another 5 minutes to get a rich consistency.</li>
                            <li>Once the milk has thickened to your desired consistency, remove it from heat. You can also add rosewater or kewra water for a floral aroma, if desired.</li>
                            <li>Now, gently immerse the rasgullas into the warm milk mixture. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes (you can refrigerate it for a longer period for better flavor).</li>
                            <li>Garnish the rasmalai with chopped pistachios, almonds, and any remaining saffron strands.</li>
                            <li>Serve chilled and enjoy!</li>
